Reproducing **["Unsupervised Learning of 3D Structure from Images"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00662)**, but developing some useful tools in the process.

More info on how to run the experiments coming soon. Currently the repo is a bit of a mess but all the code is there, i.e. Rezende's rotating cubes/spheres/other primitives work.
